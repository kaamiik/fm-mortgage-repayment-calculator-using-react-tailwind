### What I learned

Working on this challenge has been an insightful journey that deepened my understanding of React and reinforced my commitment to following the JS frameworks learning path. In this project, I:

- **Enhanced Form Handling in React:**  
  Built a project centered around forms to practice handling user input. I experimented with form submission, validation messages, and dynamic state updates, ensuring that the related components re-render correctly upon form submission.

- **Customized Component Implementation:**  
  Leveraged non-styled components from react-aria (including the number field and radio buttons) and applied my own styling. This not only improved the UI but also expanded my knowledge on how to integrate and modify third-party components.

- **Modular Component Design:**  
  Designed and implemented multiple reusable components such as:

  - **Button**
  - **Calculator Section** (which manages local state to handle re-renders)
  - **Result Section**
  - **Custom Number Field and Radio Button Components**

- **Utilized Tailwind CSS v4:**  
  Embraced Tailwind CSS, relying on its custom properties to craft unique styles that enhanced the project's look and feel. I truly enjoyed working with its utility-first approach.

Looking ahead, I plan to explore libraries like React Hook Form and Formik to streamline and further improve form management in future projects.
